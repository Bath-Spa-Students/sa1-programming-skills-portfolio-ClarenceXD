"""In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arithmetic operations, and print the result to the console.

### Steps:
1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value `8`.
2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value `10`.
3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
4. Print the value of the sum to the console."""

firstnumber = 8                                                        #variable first number is a int containing a whole number 
secondnumber = 10
results = firstnumber + secondnumber                                   #variable results is used to print the results of adding first and second number 

print (results)                                                        #prints the results that is the total of the first number and the second number
